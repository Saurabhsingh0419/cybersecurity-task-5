# ðŸ“¡ Network Traffic Analysis Report - Task 5

## ðŸ“Œ Tool:
Wireshark

## ðŸ“‹ Steps Performed:
- Captured live traffic on Wi-Fi interface
- Visited multiple websites and pinged a server to generate traffic
- Stopped capture after 2 minutes
- Filtered packets by protocols: HTTP, DNS, TCP

## ðŸ“Š Protocols Observed:
- **HTTP** â†’ Web traffic packets between browser and server
- **DNS** â†’ Name resolution queries and responses
- **TCP** â†’ Connection-oriented communication packets

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots:

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion:
This task helped understand how different protocols communicate over the network, how to filter and analyze packet data, and export captures for further analysis.
